# The Unleashed Experience

In light of Sonic Unleashed (the best Sonic game to ever bless our existence) receiving a native port to PC in the form of a Recompilation, this mod aims to bring various gameplay aspects from Sonic Unleashed to Geometry Dash.
Why? Because ***I LOVE SONIC UNLEASHED GRAAAHHHH***

This mod is better enjoyed when paired with the Sonic Robot mod, using Modern SFX and Modern/Unleashed (Java) sprites. Get the mod for the best experience!!
